# gradleProjOct21
Created gradle project...

Clone this project to your local machine go to PrjOct21/src/com/home from command prompt then compile using

javac NextLargest.java then run the program

java NextLargest

here you can enter number of digits to find highest number.

logic is something like this program is going to convert the input number in character array and then loop into it, it is starting from right side and try to find a number which smaller than digit in right most position, if finds then we need to swap them and do sorting to remaining digits after swaping position.

Added some junit cases too.
